Bluetooth Example
===========

BlueToothDemo is a simple example of how to startup a bluetooth client and server.  You will need to install
this example on two devices (not the simulators, doesn't work there).  Once the connections are made, it just 
like any other network code.

These are example code for University of Wyoming, Cosc 4730 Mobile Programming course.
All examples are for Android.
